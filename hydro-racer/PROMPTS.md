# Cozy Rapids — Art Prompts for ChatGPT

> **ChatGPT: the task list is in `hydro-racer/NEXT.md`. Art tasks = Task E.**

Do ONE sheet per message. Never redesign a character between sheets: always look at the
reference sheet already committed in `sprites/sheets/` and match it exactly.

## RULES (apply to every image)
- Original art for "Cozy Rapids" (NO Hydro Thunder boats/logos, no copyrighted characters or brands).
- Style: cute chibi 2D cartoon, soft pastel colours, clean thick dark outlines (#2f3b5c deep navy-blue), soft cel shading, same look as the other MyCozyWorld games. It will be used as small billboards/textures in a **low-res PS1-style 3D game**, so keep shapes bold and simple, and avoid tiny details.
- Canvas exactly 1536x1024 px, PNG.
- Sprite sheets: flat solid magenta `#FF00FF` background everywhere (no gradient, no shadow, no texture). Grid 3 columns x 2 rows, each cell 512x512, one item per cell, centred, nothing touching the cell edges (40 px margin).
- Texture sheets (marked TEXTURE): NO magenta, grid 3x2 of 512x512 **seamlessly tileable** squares, flat lighting, no perspective.
- No text, no labels, no grid lines.
- Commit the PNG straight to GitHub repo `azlanyusuff3/MyCozyWorld`, branch `main`, path `hydro-racer/sprites/sheets/<filename>`. Do not touch any other file.
